    <div class="entry-content text-justify">
        <p>WELCOME TO ALL FarmwayFresh AND THANK YOU FOR REGISTERING WITH US! IT IS IMPORTANT THAT YOU REVIEW THIS AGREEMENT BECAUSE, BY ACCESSING THIS WEBSITE, BY PLACING AN ORDER WITH US BY TELEPHONE, EMAIL, FAX, OR THROUGH THIS WEBSITE, YOU ARE AGREEING TO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS THAT GOVERN THE USE OF THE SITE AND THE TERMS UPON WHICH WE AGREE TO DELIVER TO YOU.</p>
        <p>By placing an order with us by telephone, fax, email, or online, you agree to the terms of this Agreement (the “Agreement”) which shall cover the terms of our deliveries to you and your use of our website. This Agreement is between you and All FarmwayFresh (the “Company” or “All FarmwayFresh”) that states the terms and conditions under which you may use the Site and receive deliveries from us. All FarmwayFresh is the owner of the following trademarks: All FarmwayFresh, www.allseasonsgrocery.com, and the All FarmwayFresh logo. This Agreement is binding on you whether you purchase from us via the telephone, email, fax, or our website.</p>
        <p><strong>OUR DELIVERY SERVICE<br />
        </strong>When you place an order, we use all reasonable efforts to deliver to you at the time of your choosing or by 5:00 pm on the day of your arrival. Once you place your order by telephone, fax, email, or online, we will act as bailee for the ordered products. You can modify an existing order at any time up until the order leaves the store by calling our customer service number at 435-655-5071 or 435-655-1914. Please note that we reserve the right to refuse service to anyone. We reserve the right to change the cost of deliveries and/or our delivery fees at any time.</p>
        <p><strong>PRICE AND AVAILABILITY<br />
        </strong>From time to time, products you order may be unavailable. If we are unable to fulfill your entire order, we will make every reasonable effort to substitute the closest product. We do not set the prices for the items you select on your grocery list. We pay the prices that each individual store has already set.</p>
        <p>To receive delivery, you do not need to be present to receive your order from our driver. In the case of bad weather or unforeseen delivery complications, deliveries may be delayed. We will make every effort to get your groceries to you by 5:00 pm on the date of your arrival.</p>
        <p>Your order will arrive with an invoice that will list all of the items you have received and were billed for. If something is missing from your order, please call us so that we can do everything reasonable in our power to ensure your satisfaction.
            <br /> In the case where you fail to pay for the products ordered, you agree to forfeit to the Company any right, title, or interest you may have in the products.</p>
        <p>Product information contained on the website or in our advertisements is offered as a convenience and should not be deemed as accurate. Information contained on the website or in our advertisements should not be used by you to evaluate ingredient information, nutritional values, or potential food allergies. The Company assumes no responsibility for such information.</p>
        <p>Our drivers are allowed to accept tips. Customers are under no obligation to tip drivers but have the option of doing so at their discretion.</p>
        <p><strong>PAYMENT<br />
        </strong>We accept only credit/debit cards. In the event your card is declined, we reserve the right to collect funds for any uncollected transactions owed us should a payment made via credit card be declined. If you fail to pay any fees or charges when due, we may charge such amount directly to the credit card identified in your Customer Account Information and we may suspend or terminate your access to our Service. You shall be responsible and liable for any fees, including but not limited to attorney’s fees and collection costs, that we may incur in our efforts to collect any unpaid balances from you.
            <br /> From time to time, we may permit you to order and receive products from businesses that we don’t use on a regular basis. In such instances, we act only as the link between you and such businesses. The purchase, payment, warranty, guaranty, delivery, maintenance, and all other matters concerning the merchandise, services, or information ordered or received from such businesses are covered by their customer agreement and policies and solely between you and such businesses. We make no representations or warranties of any kind, express or implied, regarding the merchandise received from these businesses and the fact that we make such products available should not be construed as an endorsement of these businesses or the products they provide.</p>

        <p><strong>YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION<br />
        </strong>You are responsible for, and agree to pay promptly, all charges to your account, including applicable taxes and purchases by you or anyone you allow to use your credit card. You agree and accept responsibility for keeping all your account information current, including name, credit card information, telephone number, and e-mail address.

        <p><strong>PURCHASE OF ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES<br />
        </strong>By Utah State Law, purchasers of alcoholic beverages must be at least twenty-one (21) years of age. You may not legally order any alcoholic beverages unless you are at least twenty-one (21) years of age. Furthermore, you may not purchase alcoholic beverages for anyone who is under the age of twenty-one (21). You must present identification and proof of age to receive alcoholic beverages. We reserve the right to refuse service, terminate accounts, remove alcoholic beverages, or cancel orders at our sole discretion. Once you check out, you have affirmatively stated and certified that you are old enough to legally purchase alcohol and/or tobacco products and that you are purchasing such products for your own consumption and no other purpose. In the case of alcohol, you state and certify that you are 21 years of age or older. In the case of tobacco products, you state and certify that you are 18 years of age or older. You further certify that you will personally receive the alcoholic beverages and/or tobacco products and that you will have your identification available for inspection or you will fax your identification ahead of time where it will be kept on file for future orders.
            <br /> IT IS A VIOLATION PUNISHABLE UNDER LAW FOR ANY PERSON UNDER THE AGE OF TWENTY-ONE TO PRESENT ANY WRITTEN EVIDENCE OF AGE WHICH IS FALSE, FRAUDULENT, OR NOT ACTUALLY HIS/HER OWN FOR THE PURPOSE OF ATTEMPTING TO PURCHASE ANY ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGE.</p>

        <p><strong>WARRANTY DISCLAIMER; LIMITATION OF LIABILITY; INDEMNIFICATION<br />
        </strong>You expressly agree that use of our service, the site, and the internet is entirely at your own risk. Our service, the site, and its contents are provided on an “as is”, “as available” basis. To the extent permitted by applicable law, we disclaim all representations and warranties of any kind, whether express or implied, including, without limitation, the warranties of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose, with respect to our service, the site, or its contents or with respect to any information, services, and products provided through or in connection with our service; we do not adopt any representation or warranty of any manufacturer or merchant of any such information, service, or products. We make no representations or warranties of any kind as to the availability, accuracy, or content of any information, services, or products obtained through the site or the service.

        <p>Neither the company nor any of its owners, employees, affiliates, agents, representatives, third-party information providers, merchants, or licensors shall be liable for any damages of any kind, including, without limitation, compensatory, direct, indirect, special, incidental, consequential, or punitive damages; loss of data, income, or profit; or loss or damage to property, arising out of or in connection with the use of our service, or the inability to use, the site, the resort delivery service, or the internet. The Company’s delivery liability shall be limited to providing you with a refund for any product that is returned. Your sole and exclusive remedy hereunder shall be for you to discontinue your use of our service and to terminate this agreement. We reserve the right to limit your order or the quantity of a specific product you may order.

        <p><strong>ENTIRE AGREEMENT<br />
        </strong>This Agreement and the Privacy Policy referred to herein represent your entire agreement with All FarmwayFresh regarding the use of the service and the Site. You agree that this Agreement is not intended to confer and does not confer any rights or remedies upon any person other than you and All FarmwayFresh. If any portion of this Agreement is held invalid or unenforceable, that portion shall be construed in accordance with applicable law as nearly as possible to reflect the original intention of the parties, and the remainder of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect. The failure of either party to insist upon strict performance of any provision of this Agreement shall not be construed as a waiver of any provision or right. This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of Utah without regard to its conflict of rules. You expressly agree that exclusive jurisdiction for any claim or dispute with All FarmwayFresh or relating in any way to your use of the service or the Site resides in the federal and state courts of Utah and you further expressly consent and agree to personal jurisdiction by the state and federal courts sitting in the State of Utah in connection with any such dispute, including any claim involving All FarmwayFresh. Any cause of action by you must be instituted within one year after the claim or cause of action has arisen, or be barred.</p>
        <p><strong>FUTURE AMENDMENTS<br />
        </strong>All FarmwayFresh may amend this Agreement at any time by posting the amended terms on our Site. All amended terms shall automatically be effective at the time they are initially posted on our Site.
